# Full-Stack Assignment

This repository contains a full-stack application with three main parts:

-   `/dsa`: A placeholder for Data Structures and Algorithms solutions.
-   `/frontend`: A React application that displays a user directory.
-   `/backend`: A Node.js (Express) API for a simple to-do list.

## Overview

This project is designed to showcase a range of skills, from frontend development with React to backend development with Node.js. Each folder contains its own `README.md` with specific instructions for that part of the project.
